# Zephyr Panel
This project is heavily inspired by <a href="https://pterodactyl.io">Pterodactyl</a> and <a href="https://pelican.dev">Pelican</a> panels. They are both made by the same team, so the difference is really just the UI and possibly the backend has some adjustments.
<br>
Primarily, I am coding this myself with Go, Tauri and NextJS, using <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com">shadcn/ui</a>. But since I have never made such a project before, I take inspiration (and maybe copy a little :D) by the code from Pterodactyl's open-source daemon and front-end.
